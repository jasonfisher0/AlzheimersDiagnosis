For data cleaning, I selected 7 of the 35 columns that might be relevant in predicting an Alzheimer’s Diagnosis then mutated the continuous variables into binary ones to fit my Bernoulli model."

    "text": "Some factors can predict Alzheimer’s Disease with more accuracy than others. People with low Functional Assessment test scores, low Activities of Daily Living scores, memory complaints, and behavioral problems had the highest odds of predicting Alzheimer’s. Using health data from 2149 patients ages 60-90, this project explores the most effective predictors of Alzheimer’s disease as of now. It seems that poor physical functioning, rather than the expected poor cognitive functioning or higher age, has a greater odd of predicting Alzheimer’s disease in a person age 60-90."
